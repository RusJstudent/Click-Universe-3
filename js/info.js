const guide = `Attack enemies to earn resourses.
Beware of npcs from the bottom of the 
list, they are strong enough!

If hitpoints (green line) goes to 0, your 
ship will be destroyed and all progress zeroed. 

Each enemy you destroy gives you 
some amount of exp, btc and plt.
For btc and plt you can buy userful equipment 
in shop. Experience let your level grow up and 
rank too!

Guns give you more damage, so you 
kill npcs faster and get less damage from them.

Shield increase your total hitpoints.`;

/* 
I published link for the game in my discord group.
Link-invitation: https://discord.gg/tshU2eTt or you can find link under any of my YT videos.

to fix:
1. destroy button on phone ("show my" only is visible);
2. pay attention on btc amount with first launch of the game (may be incorrect)
3. Background должен быть один на всех устройствах
// Запретить увеличение экрана на сенсоре (пофиксил, проверить)

made today:
1. shields
2. damage display (with small animation)
3. ship little animation

soon: 
1. better damage animation
2. sell option
3. autofarm option
4. warranks

probably (later):
1. rank name and damage quantity in profile
2. menu
3. quests
4. more ships
